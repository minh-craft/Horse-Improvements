## Description
Makes horse riding more immersive with acceleration and camera bobbing and weightiness.

- Horse riding is now acceleration based.
- Turning while riding takes time and is no longer instantaneous.
- Adds subtle camera bobbing while riding.
- Horse head bobbing is tuned to match camera bobbing.
- Everything is configurable.
